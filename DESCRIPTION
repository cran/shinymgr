Description: A unifying framework for managing and deploying 'shiny' applications 
    that consist of modules, where an "app" is a tab-based workflow that guides 
    a user step-by-step through an analysis. The 'shinymgr' app builder 
    "stitches" 'shiny' modules together so that outputs from one module serve as 
    inputs to the next, creating an analysis pipeline that is easy to implement 
    and maintain. Users of 'shinymgr' apps can save analyses as an RDS file that
    fully reproduces the analytic steps and can be ingested into an R Markdown 
    report for rapid reporting. In short, developers use the 'shinymgr' 
    framework to write modules and seamlessly combine them into 'shiny' apps, and 
    users of these apps can execute reproducible analyses that can be 
    incorporated into reports for rapid dissemination.
