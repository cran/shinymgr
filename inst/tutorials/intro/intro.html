Introduction</h2>
<p>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web
apps straight from R<span class="citation"><sup>1</sup></span>. As
Hadley Wickham, author of Mastering Shiny<span
class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span>, writes, “<em>Today, Shiny is used
in almost as many niches and industries as R itself is. It’s used in
academia as a teaching tool for statistical concepts, a way to get
undergrads excited about learning to write code, a splashy medium for
showing off novel statistical methods or models. It’s used by big pharma
companies to speed collaboration between scientists and analysts during
drug development. It’s used by Silicon Valley tech companies to set up
realtime metrics dashboards that incorporate advanced
analytics.</em>”</p>
<p>Shiny applications can range from simple to complex, each with an
intended purpose developed for an intended user audience (Figure 1).</p>
<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>
<p>Shiny apps can be deployed on a server (such as <a
href="https://www.shinyapps.io/"
class="uri">https://www.shinyapps.io/</a>), or they can be deployed in R
directly, where a desktop machine serves as the local host. Many R
packages today include a Shiny application that can be used to
streamline analyses or illustrate a workflow.</p>
<p>Complex applications, such as the Radiant Shiny app shown in Figure
1, may have multiple tabs, inputs, and functionalities. Radiant allows
users to work with datasets, design experiments, run many kinds of
analyses, and produce reports in a variety of formats. However, from the
developer perspective, complex applications can result in many lines of
code, creating challenges for collaborating, debugging, streamlining,
and maintaining the overall product.</p>
<p>Shiny modules are a solution to this problem. As stated by Winston
Chang, “<em>A Shiny module is a piece of a Shiny app. It can’t be
directly run, as a Shiny app can. Instead, it is included as part of a
larger app (or as part of a larger Shiny module – they are composable).
Modules can represent input, output, or both. They can be as simple as a
single output, or as complicated as a multi-tabbed interface festooned
with controls/outputs driven by multiple reactive expressions and
observers. Once created, a Shiny module can be easily reused – whether
across different apps, or multiple times in a single app.</em>” –
source: <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/"
class="uri">https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/</a>.</p>
<p>Several authors have contributed R packages for distributing
pre-written modules for general use, including the
<em>datamods</em><span class="citation"><sup>3</sup></span>,
<em>shiny.reglog</em><span class="citation"><sup>4</sup></span>,
periscope<span class="citation"><sup>5</sup></span>,
<em>shinyauthr</em><span class="citation"><sup>6</sup></span>,
<em>modchart</em><span class="citation"><sup>7</sup></span>, and
<em>jsmodule</em><span class="citation"><sup>8</sup></span>
packages.</p>
<p>While shiny modules offer several benefits, challenges can arise in
the development of apps that use modules, such as tracking available
modules, testing them, storing them, and stitching them together into an
app where outputs from one module can serve as inputs to the next. Taken
together, these elements permit an expedient analysis pipeline or
workflow that is fully reproducible<span
class="citation"><sup>9–11</sup></span>. Moreover, the pipeline should
permit rapid reporting to convey the results of an analysis workflow to
a target audience (Figure 2).</p>
<div class="figure">

<h2>Introducing shinymgr</h2>
<p>Here, we introduce <em>shinymgr</em>, an R package that provides a
unifying framework for managing and deploying Shiny applications that
consist of modules. From the user’s perspective, an “app” consists of a
series of RShiny tabs that are presented in order, establishing an
analysis workflow (Figure 3). The inputs and outputs of a given app can
be saved as an .RDS file to ensure reproducibility. Further, the .RDS
file may be loaded into an R Markdown (.Rmd) or Quarto (.qmd) template
for rapid reporting.</p>
<hr>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/appImage.PNG" alt="*Figure 3. The main panel shows the 'iris_explorer' app, which consists of three tabs that guide a user through a workflow. Tab 1 is displayed.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>Figure 3. The main panel shows the ‘iris_explorer’ app, which
consists of three tabs that guide a user through a workflow. Tab 1 is
displayed.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>From the developer’s perspective, each tab in an “app” consists of
one or more Shiny modules. Each tab is defined as focused,
compartmentalized code that typically has a singular objective. Modules
are the basic element in the <em>shinymgr</em> framework; they can be
used and re-used across different tabs and different apps. The
<em>shinymgr</em> app builder “stitches” shiny modules together so that
outputs from one module serve as inputs to the next, creating an
analysis pipeline that is easy to implement and maintain.</p>
<p>In short, developers use the <em>shinymgr</em> framework to write
modules and seamlessly combine them into shiny apps, and users of these
apps can execute reproducible analyses that can be incorporated into
reports for rapid dissemination.</p>

## [12] &quot;deployment: Deploying a shinymgr project for your purposes.&quot;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>👉🏾 We highly recommend that you create a new RStudio project (folder)
that is your home base for working through tutorials. Once there, open R
and ensure this folder is your working directory. Our tutorial examples
will use <code>getwd()</code> to reference your home base in many
tutorials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch a tutorial with the <em>learnr</em>
<code>run_tutorial()</code> function, providing the name of the module
to launch like this:</p>
<pre class="r bg-success"><code>learnr::run_tutorial(
  name = &quot;modules&quot;, 
  package = &quot;shinymgr&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>The tutorial should launch in a browser, which has the benefit of
being able to print the tutorial to PDF upon completion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👉🏼 If you have a large monitor, or even 2 monitors, you may find it
very useful to run the tutorials as described, but to also launch a
second instance of R that is not running a tutorial. This will allow you
to try out some code outside the tutorial environment. To do so, select
Session | New Session from the main toolbar in RStudio.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="section-how-to-use-learnr-tutorials" class="section level2">
<h2>How to use <em>learnr</em> tutorials</h2>
<p>All tutorials were written with the R package, <em>learnr</em>.
You’re looking at the introductory tutorial. Each tutorial is divided
into topics, which can be seen in the left menu. As you work though the
topics, your progression is saved. This means you can close out when
needed and pick up where you left off at a later time. The <em>very
small</em> “Start Over” button at the bottom of the left menu will sweep
clean any progress so you can start afresh if needed.</p>
<p>Tutorials consist of written content (like you’re reading now) and R
examples, but may also include short videos, interactive R coding and
demos, and quizzes.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="intro" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="intro-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-tutorial-formatting" class="section level2">
<h2>Tutorial formatting</h2>
<p>Tutorials are designed to be informative and engaging. If we want to
highlight a key concept, we will place in a large yellow box, like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👉🏽 Hey! This is important!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to show you how to do something in R, you should see a
green colored “code chunk” that illustrates something, like this:</p>
<pre class="r bg-success"><code># add 1 + 1
1 + 1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>The inputs into R are shaded green, and typically include a short
comment that starts with a hashtag (e.g., # add 1 + 1). Comments are not
executed by R; they are notes to the programmer (you!). The outputs are
identified by the double hashtag symbol enclosed in a gray or white box
as shown above.</p>
<p>If you have a second instance of RStudio open and would like to
follow along, you could copy this code and paste it into your R console
and execute it in that second instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👉🏿 When a <em>learnr</em> tutorial is active, your R console cannot
be accessed because it is “busy” with the tutorial. Instead of coding in
the R console, coding is done directly in the tutorial, as you’ll see in
a few seconds. This is why running a second instance of R may be useful
– it will not be locked into the tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tutorials are designed to give you hands-on practice. Exercises are
identified with instructions provided in a steel blue box, like
this:</p>
<p class="instructions">
Enter the equation 1 + 1 in the box below, and execute it by pressing
the “Run Code” button.

<p>Hints may or may not be included, so make sure to look for them!
Press the “Hint” button to see the hint.</p>
<p>Quizzes may include short answers or multiple choice questions, like
this one provided by the authors of the <em>learnr</em> package:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Your answers are saved in the tutorial itself (unless you press Start
Over button in the left menu, which will erase any previous work).</p>
<p>Tutorials may include Shiny elements, like the one below showing the
waiting time between eruptions for the Old Faithful geyser in
Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. In this case, R receives
“user-inputs” from a slider and produces a histogram output of waiting
times. Because <em>shinymgr</em> is an R package that helps organize,
test, and combine Shiny modules into a larger application, many of the
tutorials will include R Shiny.</p>
<p class="instructions">
Use the slider to change the number of grouping “bins” in the histogram
below:
</p>
<div class="form-group shiny-input-container">
<label class="control-label" id="bins-label" for="bins">Number of bins:</label>
<input class="js-range-slider" id="bins" data-skin="shiny" data-min="1" data-max="50" data-from="30" data-step="1" data-grid="true" data-grid-num="9.8" data-grid-snap="false" data-prettify-separator="," data-prettify-enabled="true" data-keyboard="true" data-data-type="number"/>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>You’re finished! If you are new to shiny, the next tutorial provides
an overview of Shiny, where you will build a simple shiny app featuring
the iris dataset.</p>
<pre class="r bg-success"><code>learnr::run_tutorial(
  name = &quot;shiny&quot;, 
  package = &quot;shinymgr&quot;

<p>If you are experienced with shiny, modules, and testing, you can
safely jump to the “shinymgr” tutorial (tutorial #6). See you there!</p>
